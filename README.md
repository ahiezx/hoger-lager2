# Game Rules
## Introduction

    - This is a basic implementation of higher or lower
    - The computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100
    - The player will guess if the next number will be higher or lower
    - If the player is correct, they win 5 points
    - If the player is incorrect, they lose 3 points
    - The game ends when the player has 0 points
    - The player can reset the game at any time


### Difficulty:
    Increase the difficulty every 100 points earned

    When the difficulty is increased, when you guess wrong you lose 5 points times the difficulty
    
        Difficulty 1: 5 points
        Difficulty 2: 10 points
        Difficulty 3: 15 points
        and so on...
